# Fruits-and-Vegetable-Recognition-System-using-CNN

This project aims to develop a system that can automatically recognize fruits and vegetables from images.

## Project Overview

•	Purpose: Identify and classify different fruits and vegetables based on their visual features.

•	Applications: Potential applications include:

    o	Assisting in grocery shopping and identification.
  
    o	Supporting dietary planning and tracking.
  
    o	Facilitating automated sorting and packaging in agriculture.

## Dependencies

     •	Programming language: Python: https://www.python.org/
     •	Libraries: Numpy, Tensorflow, Matplotlib and Streamlit

## Dataset

    •	Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition
    •	Number of classes: 36 classes

## Model

•	Type of model: Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

## Result

o	Input: Open VScode then run "streamlit run main.py"![image](https://github.com/ajaypandit0994253/Fruits-and-Vegetable-Recognition-System-using-CNN/assets/129199295/739b6304-0437-4ac6-b7d8-d951f249ce7f)

## Future Work

Identification of fruits and vegetables are implemented in different areas. The most common areas are identification in the retail business, and in areas where the purpose is to ease the harvest in the perspective of agriculture.

In the retail business, the identification is mostly done manually by a cashier, or via the self-service systems in a store.

We can present a system that makes use of computer vision to automatize the identification process of fruits and vegetables by self-service systems in the retail market.

Another goal has been to create a user-friendly system, as measured by usability studies.
